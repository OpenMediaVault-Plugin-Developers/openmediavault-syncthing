Description: Syncthing plugin for OpenMediaVault.
 Syncthing replaces proprietary sync and cloud services with something
 open, trustworthy and decentralized. Your data is your data alone and
 you deserve to choose where it is stored, if it is shared with some
 third party and how it's transmitted over the Internet.
